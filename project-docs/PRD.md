**Project Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Title**: LLM Evaluation Platform

**Overview**:
The LLM Evaluation Platform is a full-stack web application designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) against specific tasks. It will allow users to input prompts, run experiments with different LLMs, and analyze their performance using metrics such as accuracy, relevancy, and response time. The platform is intended to help startups determine the best combination of LLMs and system prompts for their use cases.

---

**Goals**:

1. Provide a user-friendly interface to create and run experiments.
2. Compare LLM responses side-by-side for multiple test cases.
3. Visualize performance metrics in an analytics dashboard.
4. Store user prompts, test cases, and experiment results for future reference.

---

**Features**:

1. **Experiment Management**:

   - Users can create experiments by inputting system prompts and selecting LLMs.
   - Experiments can include multiple test cases (e.g., user messages and expected outputs).

2. **Test Case Grading**:

   - Implement grading mechanisms for test cases:
     - Exact Match
     - Partial Match (e.g., cosine similarity)
     - LLM Match (using another LLM for evaluation)

3. **Metrics and Analytics**:

   - Provide metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Relevancy
     - Response Time
   - Display metrics in a dashboard with visualizations (e.g., graphs, charts).

4. **Database Management**:

   - Store experiments, test cases, results, and user data in a scalable database.
   - Support relational data for experiments and test cases.

5. **Scalability**:

   - Handle large-scale experiments with thousands of test cases.
   - Optimize database queries and API performance.

6. **LLM Integration**:
   - Use Groq LLM API to process prompts and retrieve responses.
   - Allow future integration with other LLMs.

**Technical Requirements**:

1. **Frontend**:

   - Framework: React + TypeScript
   - Libraries: Axios, React Router, Chart.js/D3.js
   - Features:
     - Experiment creation forms
     - Test case management interface
     - Dashboard for analytics

2. **Backend**:

   - Framework: Node.js (Express)
   - Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for schema design)
   - Features:
     - RESTful API for experiments and test cases
     - Integration with Groq LLM API
     - Data validation and error handling

3. **Hosting**:

   - Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
   - Backend: AWS/Render/Heroku
   - Database: MongoDB Atlas

4. **APIs**:
   - **Groq LLM API** for generating responses
   - Custom API endpoints for CRUD operations:
     - `/api/experiments` (POST, GET)
     - `/api/experiments/:id/run` (POST)
     - `/api/results/:experimentId` (GET)

**User Stories**:

1. As a user, I want to create an experiment by inputting a system prompt and selecting an LLM.
2. As a user, I want to add multiple test cases to an experiment.
3. As a user, I want to run an experiment and see responses from the selected LLM.
4. As a user, I want to view metrics for each experiment in a dashboard.
5. As a user, I want to compare LLM responses side-by-side for test cases.
6. As an admin, I want the backend to handle thousands of experiments efficiently.

**Considerations**:

1. **Performance**:

   - Ensure APIs and database queries are optimized for scalability.
   - Implement caching (e.g., Redis) if needed for frequent queries.

2. **Usability**:

   - Ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience for creating and managing experiments.
   - Provide clear visualizations and feedback for metrics.

3. **Security**:

   - Use environment variables for API keys.
   - Secure backend endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.

4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Support additional LLMs for evaluation.
   - Enable user accounts and authentication for personalized experiments.
   - Allow integration with external datasets for benchmarking.

---

**Timeline**:

1. **Week 1**:

   - Set up the project structure and development environment.
   - Build basic frontend and backend boilerplate.

2. **Week 2**:

   - Implement experiment creation and test case management.
   - Integrate Groq LLM API.

3. **Week 3**:

   - Build the analytics dashboard.
   - Optimize database and API performance.

4. **Week 4**:
   - Conduct testing and debugging.
   - Deploy the application.

---

**Deliverables**:

1. Fully functional web application deployed on Vercel (frontend) and AWS/Render (backend).
2. Source code repository on GitHub.
3. A 3-minute video demo of the application.
4. Documentation outlining setup, features, and challenges.

**Risks and Mitigation**:

1. **API Limits**:

   - Risk: Exceeding Groq LLM API rate limits.
   - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting and queuing for API calls.

2. **Scalability Issues**:

   - Risk: Performance degradation with large-scale experiments.
   - Mitigation: Optimize database queries and implement caching.

3. **UI Complexity**:
   - Risk: Overcomplicating the UI for experiment creation.
   - Mitigation: Conduct user testing to ensure simplicity and clarity.
